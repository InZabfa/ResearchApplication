Software Development Dissertation project - Android application for researchers

<h3>About</h3>
<p>This was a project for my dissertation. Unfortunately, due to restricted time I wasn't able to fully develop all the intended functionalities. It has all the basis for the possible future development into a full working application with all the features that were intended during the design stage of my dissertation. This is an Android application that uses Xamarin (allows for future development into other mobile OS systems). It is written in C# with the ASP.NET web API to allow faster querying of SQL server database.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that this is an application that relies on the online API which can only currently run locally it requires for the device to connect to the host to be able to access the database (in case of connecting a mobile device for the testing purposes) with emulator that is not required however only disadvantage of doing it is the emulator is not an accurate representation of the application compared to testing it on the actual device.</p>

<h3> Licence </h3>
<p> Due to the fact that this was a dissertation part of the copyright goes partly to the University of Liverpool as well as me. </p>
